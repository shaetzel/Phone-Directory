# Phone-Directory
This project consists of various files that allow the user to build, modify, view
and save a phone directory. 

The DirectoryEntry class creates a DirectoryEntry object which has both a name and 
number. This class also contains function definitions that allow the instances of the
DirectoryEntry to be accessed and mutated.

The PhoneDirectory class creates an array list of DirectoryENtry objects and then 
defines a wide variety of methods including the addOrChangeEntry, the searchEntry, the
removeEntry and the displayAllEntries functions. This class allows for the creation of
a phone book which the user can interact with in various ways.
